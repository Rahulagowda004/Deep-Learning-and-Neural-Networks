# 🧠 Deep Learning Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of these advanced deep learning techniques to solve complex tasks such as classification, image processing, and sequence prediction.

## 🤖 Algorithms Included:

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** 🧠  
   A foundational deep learning model inspired by the structure of the human brain. Used for tasks like classification, regression, and prediction.

2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** 🖼️  
   A type of neural network especially effective for processing grid-like data such as images. Used in image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

3. **Perceptron Models** ⚙️  
   The simplest form of a neural network, used as a binary classifier. A single-layer perceptron can classify linearly separable data.

4. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)** 🔁  
   A type of neural network designed for sequence data, commonly used in tasks like time-series forecasting, language modeling, and speech recognition.

## 🚀 Usage

Each algorithm has its own Python file, which can be run independently. To use any algorithm:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rahulagowda004/Deep-Learning-and-Neural-Networks.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired algorithm directory and run the Python file:
   ```bash
   cd <algorithm-directory>
   python <algorithm-file>.py
   ```

## 📋 Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the algorithms:

- `numpy` ➕
- `pandas` 🐼
- `tensorflow` 🧑‍💻
- `keras` 🧩
- `matplotlib` 📊
